## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* added vignettes to package build

* Enclosed long-running examples with \dontrun{}

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 2 NOTES:

* Package has a VignetteBuilder field but no prebuilt vignette index.

* Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 10s
                   user system elapsed
